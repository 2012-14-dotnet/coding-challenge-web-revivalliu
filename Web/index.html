                    <p class = "text">in the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctore of medicine of the university of london, and proceeded to Netly to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to teh Fifth Northumberaland fusiliers as assistant surgeon. The regiment was stationed at inia at the time, and before i could join it, the second afghan war had broken out. on landing at bombay, i learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country.</p>
